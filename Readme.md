The **DevExpress Mobile UI for Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI** is free of charge. To learn more about our offer and to reserve your copy, visit [Free DevExpress Mobile UI for Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI](https://www.devexpress.com/xamarin-free).

## Requirements

## What's in This Repository

In v22.1.1-pre-22115, the **DevExpress Mobile UI for .NET MAUI** suite does not include the `TabPage`, `DrawerPage`, and `DrawerView` components that were supported in previous previews. See the following breaking change for more information: [Navigation controls for .NET MAUI have been removed](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/internal/ticket/details/T1085745).

This example shows how to replace the `DrawerPage` with the `FlyoutPage` to implement a similar functionality. See the following pull request for changes: [Replace drawer with flyout](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/maui-drawer-page-get-started/pull/3/files).
